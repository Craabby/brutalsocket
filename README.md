# brutalsocket
This is pretty much just a ripoff of [diepsocket](https://github.com/Cazka/diepsocket/blob/master/src/diepsocket.js) but for brutal.io

for it to work you need to cd to the folder you installed it to and run 
```
npm i
```
the event listeners are `open`, `message`, `close`, and `error`
